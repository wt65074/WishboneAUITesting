Bamboo 5.9.1-#5914 README
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Thank you for downloading Bamboo 5.9.1 - Server distribution.  This
distribution comes with a built-in Tomcat 7.0.59-atlassian-01 web server and hsql
database, so it runs (almost) out the box.


BRIEF INSTALL GUIDE
-------------------


1. Install a Java Development Kit (JDK) version 1.6 or above from

   http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

2. Set the JAVA_HOME variable to where you installed Java.


3. Set your Bamboo Home directory.
   Instructions how to set your Bamboo Home directory can be found here: https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BAMBOO/Installing+and+upgrading+Bamboo


4. Run bin/start-bamboo.sh (*nix) or bin\start-bamboo.bat (Windows).
   Check that there are no errors on the console.  See below for troubleshooting advice.

PROBLEMS?
---------
A common startup problem is when another program has claimed port 8085, which
Bamboo is configured to run on by default.  To avoid this port conflict, Bamboo's
port can be changed in conf/server.xml.

If you have installation (or other) problems, please see the resources
listed at https://support.atlassian.com
